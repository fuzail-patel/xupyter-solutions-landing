# Refactor: "Why Join Us" Section – Layout & Structure

Focus ONLY on layout and structural presentation.
Content can be adjusted slightly, but the primary goal is to improve hierarchy, clarity, and visual weight.

The current version feels like generic SaaS benefit cards.
We want this to feel intentional, structured, and system-driven.

---

## 1. Rename the Section

Replace "WHY JOIN US" with one of the following:

* How We Work
* Working at Xupyter
* How Our Team Operates

Use a stronger, more grounded tone.

Add a short 1–2 line intro under the heading explaining that this section describes how the team actually operates.

Keep it compact.

---

## 2. Layout Direction (Primary Recommendation)

### Use a Two-Column Structured Layout (Desktop)

Left Column (40% width):

* Section title
* Short intro paragraph
* Optional single strong sentence reinforcing culture

Right Column (60% width):

* Stacked benefit blocks (not equal “cards”)
* Clear vertical rhythm

This immediately makes it feel more editorial and less like a marketing grid.

On mobile:

* Stack everything vertically
* Title → intro → benefit blocks

---

## 3. Redesign the Benefit Blocks

Instead of soft rounded cards with icons:

Remove heavy card backgrounds.
Reduce visual noise.

Structure each benefit block like this:

* Strong title (larger font than body)
* Short paragraph below
* Optional subtle divider between blocks

No large shadows.
No decorative gradients.

Spacing should create separation, not borders.

---

## 4. Visual Hierarchy Improvements

Each block should have:

* Clear title dominance
* Body text slightly muted
* Consistent vertical spacing (32–40px between blocks)

Use typography and spacing for hierarchy, not boxes.

---

## 5. Optional: Add Subtle Structural Accent

To make it feel system-oriented:

Option A:
Add a thin vertical accent line to the left of the stacked blocks.

Option B:
Add a faint grid background behind the entire section (very subtle).

This supports the systems positioning without being decorative.

---

## 6. Remove These Elements

* Oversized rounded cards
* Generic feature-style icons (unless extremely minimal)
* Large padded containers
* Marketing-style hover animations

This is not a product feature section.

---

## 7. Final Visual Goal

This section should feel:

* Calm
* Structured
* Intentional
* Engineering-first

It should look like a team operating manual, not a perks list.

Implement cleanly and modularly.
